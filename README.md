# Critical Mass

## Work / Project Examples
I cannot provide my currently working project and my CMPUT 401 project since they are private research projects.

### QuicyBot
This program is a sentiment analysis tool to analysis lyrics. It is powered by musixmatch and Microsoft Text Analytics. I worked on the front end part and integration test.

### Machine-Learning-Package
I am interested in ML. When I have time I always do some practices base on ML.

### CountBook
This is my CMPUT 301 assignment. I finished it by my self.

## Inspiration

## Focus
If I have time, I want to create modern and professional front end. I have developed some general front ends, but I think they are not good enough. If I can join Critical Mass, I will try to learn how to develop a good front end.
