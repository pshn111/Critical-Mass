## Work / Project Examples
I cannot provide my currently working project and my CMPUT 401 project since they are private research projects.

### QuicyBot
This program is a sentiment analysis tool to analysis lyrics. It is powered by musixmatch and Microsoft Text Analytics. I worked on the front end part and integration test.

### Machine-Learning-Package
I am interested in ML. When I have time I always do some practices base on ML.

### CountBook
This is my CMPUT 301 assignment. I finished it by my self.
